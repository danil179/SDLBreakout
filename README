Compiling:
	Compile with VS2015 (libs for VS2015 from: https://github.com/guaxiao/renderer.gua/tree/master/platform/win/SDL-1.2.15/vs2015-x86, there are problems with the original libs in SDL site).
	Check that the "Libs" folder in the solution folder, otherwise SDL includes and libs will be missing and the build will fail.
	The dlls of SDL are in the "Libs/SDL-1.2.15/dll" folder
Code:
	Followed "Google C++ Style Guide" (excluding "#pragma once" and maybe more)
	
Graphics:
	The tiles (and more) from here: opengameart.org/content/breakout-graphics-no-shadow
